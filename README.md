# TUMProductivityScripts
A collection of useful javascript files for TUM student (and employees). 

They can be used in your browser to automate tasks and save many unnecessary clicks.

*Feel free to create a PR and add your own scripts to this library for others to see!*

## How to use
Userscript can easily be added to your browser using [tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=de) (Chrome) or [greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (Firefox).

The `@match` property automatically defines on which domains the script should be triggered when using tampermonkey. So don't worry to change any settings - its just copy and paste!

### Have fun ❤️
